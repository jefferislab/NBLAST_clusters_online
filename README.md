# NBLAST clusters online

### Now live at [jefferislab.org/si/nblast/clusters/](http://jefferislab.org/si/nblast/clusters)!

This repository contains scripts and supporting files for building interactive webpages showing the clustering of neurons in [Costa et al. (2014) NBLAST: Rapid, sensitive comparison of neuronal structure and construction of neuron family databases](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/006346).

We have used affinity propagation clustering of our NBLAST scores to cluster the full FlyCircuit dataset of 16,129 neurons into 1,052 distinct clusters of highly related neurons. These clusters have been organised into superclusters, enabling both exploration of the dataset and the matching of individual clusters to morphological types reported in the literature, with these webpages being provided as a tool to enable this exploration. Each supercluster is detailed on its own page, linked to by images on the main page. These pages provide an interactive 3D model of each supercluster with links to pages detailing the clusters contained within. Interactive 3D models of each individual cluster are provided on these pages, as well as information on the constituent neurons and similar clusters as determined by NBLAST.
